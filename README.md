# DinkBot
A bot for Discord named DinkBot.

#Functionality

Commands are entered with the following syntax: 

![command name] [param 1] [param 2] ... [param x] 

Where [command name] is the name of the command the user intends to execute, and [param 1] [param 2] ... [param x] are the parameters required to execute the command (if any).

#TODO

Add ability for bot to perform administrative actions through voting (maybe?) 

Add ability for bot to access voice channel and play audio (music playlists?) 

Add ability for bot to access imgur and post straight from there (worth the effort?) 

Increase efficiency of Playlist.java.

Create Obj package for Playlist and all future usable objects.
